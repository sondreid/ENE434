# Assignment 3

When we merged the company data (AS_merged) with the exploration data expl_oper, we lost approximately 90 observations. Create a data frame of these 90 observations. Why were they dropped? What do they have in common? Are the loss of these observations problematic for our further analysis? How so?


## TASK 1
```{r}
expl_AS_full_join = expl_oper %>% left_join(AS_merged, by=c("NPD_id", "year"))

diff_set = setdiff(expl_AS_full_join, expl_AS)
```

Questions: Why were they dropped? What do they have in common? Are the loss of these observations problematic for our further analysis? How so?

### Why were they dropped? 

They were dropped because the NPD_id and year values in exploration (expl_oper) data set did not correspond with any similar values in the financial data set (AS_merged).For a left join / merge between two rows to be made both the NPD_id and year much find an equal pairing in the other data set.

### What do they have in common?







## TASK 2


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
setwd("C:/Users/Jon/OneDrive/NHH/Master/V2021/ENE434/LABS/Datafiles/")
brent_crude_set <- read.csv("Europe_Brent_Spot_Price_FOB.csv") %>% 
  tail(.,-4) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(rownames(.)),
         Europe.Brent.Spot.Price.FOB = as.numeric(Europe.Brent.Spot.Price.FOB)) %>% 
  rename(spot_price = Europe.Brent.Spot.Price.FOB)
```

Compare the average yearly (brent) oil price with expl_AS. Merging by year.

```{r}
explAGG_spot = explAgg_AS %>% 
  left_join(brent_crude_set, by = c("year"))


explAGG_spot %>% group_by(spot_price) %>%
  summarise(total_n_wells = sum(numbWells)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= spot_price, y= total_n_wells)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs()



```

## TASK 3


Overview of the CO2 taxes in the period 2009-2020. 
```{r}
CO2_tax = tibble(
  year=2009:2020,
  CO2_tax_NG_krSM3=c(0.49, 0.51, 0.44, 0.45, 0.46, 0.66,.82, 0.84, 0.90, 1, 1, 1.08)
  )

CO2_tax %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=CO2_tax_NG_krSM3)) + 
  geom_line()
```

Question: Do you think that this may effect exploratory drilling in the period studied? Do you think a correlation could be estimated with the given data (and with the addition of CO2-tax data)? Why or why not?


## TASK 4

```{r}
reg1 = lm(numbWells ~ total_assets + profitability, data=explAgg_AS)
summary(reg1)
```
Total_assets is more significant than profitability. The R-squared is quite low.
